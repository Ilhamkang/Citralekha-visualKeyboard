# Citralekha-visualKeyboard


This keyboard provides special Latin characters to be used in the transliteration and transcription system of Indonesian manuscript and inscriptions. You can type the text with your physical keyboard then klick the virtual key button for the special characters. The code is developed based on [Ganesh Kavar's On Screen Keyboard Python Project](https://github.com/ganeshkavhar/On-Screen-Keyboard-Python-Project).
